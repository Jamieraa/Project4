# Project4
Descripition: A program to generate 40 random natural numbers and  store them in a linked list/BS tree then display them in pre/in/post-order.

Input: N/A
Output: Pre,Post,In- order transversals

Procdeures: The TreeNode struct represents each node in the tree, holding a value and pointers to its left and right children. The BSTree class has private functions for recursive operations like insertion, deletion, and traversals (pre-order, in-order, and post-order). The class provides public methods for inserting values into the tree and performing traversals. In the main function, the code creates an instance, inserts values into it, and then performs traversals to display the elements in different orders.
